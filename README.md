# 📚 Programming Exercises Progress

Welcome to my repository of programming exercises!!
Inside, you'll find a collection of folders organized by programming language, each containing various exercises that i’m solving as part of my ongoing journey to improve my skills.

***⚠️The repository is divided into folders by programming language, but, <ins>this structure may grow and evolve as i continue learning</ins>⚠️***

# My Purpose??

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning process and be able to look back and see my progress but i also hope this repository can serve as a helpful reference for others who are learning to code and/or for those who may be interested in my services in the near future.

# 🛠️ Languages I Currently Use To Code

- Python

*(More languages may be added over time!!!</ins> <sub>just wait, there's a lot more to come ;)</sub> )*
